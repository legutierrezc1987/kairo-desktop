## Editing Rule (MANDATORY)

THIS FILE IS A LIVE SNAPSHOT (Option B).
Overwrite current state. Remove resolved items. Do not append historical logs here.
Historical rationale belongs to DEB/RFC/governance docs and Git history.

## Scope Boundary

This file must contain only:
- current objective
- active debates/RFCs
- pending priority list
- active risks + mitigations
- exact next step + next owner

Do not duplicate full DEC or long rationale content.

## Current Snapshot

- Active phase: Phase 7 (Testing + Hardening) — Sprint G SEALED.
- Sealed commits: `326071a` (Sprint A hardening), `3c5799c` (Sprint B + stabilization), `756ad33` (Sprint C streaming e2e), `07831d4` (Sprint D cut-pipeline e2e), `64c3813` (Phase 5 Sprint A recall), `a0b30d8` (Phase 5 Sprint B consolidation), `da6c092` (Phase 5 Sprint C rate-limit, GO), `5df7b7a` (Phase 6 Sprint A Monaco editor read/write, GO), `9fc53df` (Phase 6 Sprint B File Explorer lazy tree, GO), `5e3a168` (Phase 6 Sprint C Settings completeness, GO), `88489d1` (Phase 6 Sprint D Impact Analyzer + UndoManager, GO), `9e3e7c5` (Phase 7 Sprint A Safety Net), `856824c` (Phase 7 Sprint A Delta — extracted suites), `9295c31` (cleanup scratch + .gitignore), `ddf6952` (Phase 7 Sprint B Integration Tests), `90c8dc2` (Phase 7 Sprint C E2E Tests), `37c8cbc` (Phase 7 Sprint D electron-builder Windows installer), `e44c117` (Phase 7 Sprint E Docs + Onboarding), `e6df7ba` (Phase 7 Sprint F Beta Ops), `PENDING` (Phase 7 Sprint G Beta Distribution + Intake).
- Current objective: Distribute beta ZIP to testers. Execute closed beta per docs/11.
- Active debates: none.
- Open RFCs: none.
- IPC channels: 47 (unchanged — docs/scripts/tests-only sprint).

## Completed This Session

- **Phase 7 Sprint G — Beta Distribution + Intake Automation**:
  - `scripts/qa/create-beta-zip.ps1`: packages setup.exe + onboarding + checklist + bug template + release checklist + SHA256SUMS + README-BETA into timestamped ZIP. 8 checks.
  - `scripts/qa/aggregate-beta-evidence.ps1`: consolidates `beta-evidence-*.txt` reports into `docs/beta/BETA_DASHBOARD.md` with machine summary, hash consistency check, health metrics.
  - `docs/beta/BETA_DASHBOARD.md` v1.0: auto-generated dashboard template (updated by aggregate script).
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/beta_bug_report.md`: structured bug report with priority checkboxes, repro steps, environment, evidence collection reference.
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/beta_feedback.md`: general feedback template with categories, suggestions, "would you use" question.
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`: disables blank issues, links to docs and onboarding guide.
  - `package.json`: added `beta:zip` npm script.
  - `.gitignore`: added `beta-evidence-*.txt`, `kairo-beta-*.zip`, `beta-staging/` exclusions.
  - `tests/test_beta_distribution_integrity.mjs`: 41 assertions (beta zip script, aggregate script, QA prerequisites, npm script, gitignore, dashboard template, distribution docs).
  - `tests/test_issue_templates_integrity.mjs`: 46 assertions (directory structure, bug report 18 checks, feedback 12 checks, config.yml 6 checks, cross-references 6 checks).
  - `docs/INDEX.md`: updated canonical tree and status with dashboard + issue templates.
  - Zero production files modified.

Non-sqlite runnable total: 2042 assertions / 0 failures (34 test files).
Note: The 3 extracted suites (test_tool_schema, test_system_prompt, test_model_router) verify the same contracts as T2/T3/T4 in test_safety_net_sprint_a — they do not add new unique assertions but provide standalone runnable coverage.
SQLite-dependent tests (8 files): blocked by `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` (pre-existing `better-sqlite3` ABI mismatch in headless Node — requires `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`).
PTY-dependent test (`test_terminal_blocked_execution.mjs`): blocked by `node-pty` ABI mismatch.

## Pending (Priority Ordered)

1. Distribute beta ZIP to testers per `docs/11_KAIRO_BETA_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.
2. Smoke-test installer on fresh Windows (install -> launch -> verify terminal/chat/settings).
3. Monitor beta intake via GitHub Issues (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`).
4. Run `aggregate-beta-evidence.ps1` daily during beta to update dashboard.
5. Route next phase (Phase 8 or beyond) based on beta results.
6. Resolve Gemini API quota for real streaming smoke test (billing/project action).
7. MCP provider package resolution checkpoint (fallback still active).

## Known Risks

- Gemini API abort is client-side; aborted requests may still consume provider-side tokens.
- Gemini generateContent quota remains zero in current GCP project.
- Path-with-spaces requires `SUBST` drive + winpty.gyp patch for node-pty rebuild (`scripts/rebuild-native.js` automates this). `npm install` from a spaceless path avoids the issue entirely.
- MCP provider package remains unresolved in npm registry.
- ConPTY "AttachConsole failed" noise persists in tests; non-blocking.
- `better-sqlite3`/`node-pty` ABI dual-rebuild workflow remains required between Node tests and Electron runtime.
- `safeStorage` unavailable in headless test environments (`PLAINTEXT:` fallback path).
- Monaco worker bundle size is high (`ts.worker`/language chunks), with potential renderer memory overhead on low-end devices.
- Large directory payloads can still stress renderer if users expand very large trees repeatedly (mitigated by exclusions + caps + truncation).
- Lowering custom budget aggressively during active usage can trigger immediate session cut behavior; safe but potentially abrupt UX.

## Mitigations

- Keep live-provider tests conditional until quota/billing enabled.
- Use `node scripts/rebuild-native.js` for native module rebuilds (handles SUBST + winpty.gyp patch automatically).
- `npmRebuild: false` in electron-builder.yml — native modules must be pre-rebuilt via `scripts/rebuild-native.js` before packaging.
- Installer is unsigned (no code-signing cert) — Windows SmartScreen warning expected on first run.
- Keep local memory fallback active until MCP package checkpoint resolves.
- Treat ConPTY attach failures as non-blocking test noise (already tolerated in suite).
- Maintain documented dual-rebuild runbook for Node/Electron contexts.
- Preserve bridge-guard pattern (`hasKairoApi`/`getKairoApiOrThrow`) for renderer IPC safety.
- Keep `_isCutting` + idempotent cut lock + worker timeout as invariant in future refactors.
- Consolidation race CLOSED: `_isConsolidating` lock + SYNCED-only DB queries + atomic `markConsolidated()` + input cap.
- Recall race CLOSED: `_isRecalling` guard + UI input disable + `handleStreamingChat` rejection.
- Rate-limit race CLOSED: `retryWithBackoff` is purely sequential per call, no shared mutable state. Non-429 errors propagate immediately.
- Keep file operations async-only and workspace-bound (`FileOperationsService`) to avoid main-thread stalls and sandbox escapes.
- Clamp and validate custom budgets (`CUSTOM_BUDGET_MIN/MAX`) before persistence to prevent invalid runtime budget states.
- UndoManager uses content-based collision guard (not mtime) — Windows mtime resolution is unreliable for sub-second comparisons.
- Ephemeral undo stack cleared on project switch and app restart — no persistent state leak.

## Next Step (Exact)

Distribute beta ZIP (`kairo-beta-v0.1.0-*.zip`) to testers. Execute closed beta per docs/11.

## Next Owner

- User: distribute beta ZIP to testers, smoke-test on clean Windows, monitor GitHub Issues intake.
- Codex (orchestrator): synthesize Phase 7 closure and route Phase 8.
- Claude (implementer): standby until next sprint routed.

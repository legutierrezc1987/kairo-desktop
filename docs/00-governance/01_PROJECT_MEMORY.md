## Editing Rule (MANDATORY)

THIS FILE IS A LIVE SNAPSHOT (Option B).
Overwrite current state. Remove resolved items. Do not append historical logs here.
Historical rationale belongs to DEB/RFC/governance docs and Git history.

## Scope Boundary

This file must contain only:
- current objective
- active debates/RFCs
- pending priority list
- active risks + mitigations
- exact next step + next owner

Do not duplicate full DEC or long rationale content.

## Current Snapshot

- Active phase: Phase 7 (Testing + Hardening) — Sprint B SEALED (`ddf6952`).
- Sealed commits: `326071a` (Sprint A hardening), `3c5799c` (Sprint B + stabilization), `756ad33` (Sprint C streaming e2e), `07831d4` (Sprint D cut-pipeline e2e), `64c3813` (Phase 5 Sprint A recall), `a0b30d8` (Phase 5 Sprint B consolidation), `da6c092` (Phase 5 Sprint C rate-limit, GO), `5df7b7a` (Phase 6 Sprint A Monaco editor read/write, GO), `9fc53df` (Phase 6 Sprint B File Explorer lazy tree, GO), `5e3a168` (Phase 6 Sprint C Settings completeness, GO), `88489d1` (Phase 6 Sprint D Impact Analyzer + UndoManager, GO), `9e3e7c5` (Phase 7 Sprint A Safety Net), `856824c` (Phase 7 Sprint A Delta — extracted suites), `9295c31` (cleanup scratch + .gitignore), `ddf6952` (Phase 7 Sprint B Integration Tests).
- Current objective: Gemini post-implementation audit of Phase 7 Sprint B. Then route next sprint.
- Active debates: none.
- Open RFCs: none.
- IPC channels: 47 (unchanged — test-only sprint).

## Completed This Session

- **Phase 7 Sprint B integration tests** — commit `ddf6952`:
  - `test_gateway_integration.mjs`: 45 assertions (streaming happy path, error mapping, abort semantics, init/model resolution, rate-limit is429/backoff/retryWithBackoff). Fake SDK pattern with configurable `_fakeConfig`.
  - `test_mcp_fallback_integration.mjs`: 35 assertions (local-only mode, MCP crash→fallback, workspace change degradation DEC-025, payload hardening). Real LocalMarkdownProvider with temp dirs.
  - `test_cut_pipeline_integration.mjs`: 40 assertions (streaming chat + rate-limit retry, auto-cut triggers turns/tokens, recall integration session_start/periodic/timeout, project switch, lifecycle safety). Rate-limit `sleep()` patched to no-op.
  - Gates: G1-G3 (45+35+40=120 PASS), G4 (streaming 54/54), G5 (rate-limit 66/66), G6 (settings 94/94), G7 (tsc exit 0), G8 (build PASS), G9 (3 test files only).
  - Zero production files modified.

Non-sqlite runnable total: 1752 assertions / 0 failures (27 test files).
Note: The 3 extracted suites (test_tool_schema, test_system_prompt, test_model_router) verify the same contracts as T2/T3/T4 in test_safety_net_sprint_a — they do not add new unique assertions but provide standalone runnable coverage.
SQLite-dependent tests (8 files): blocked by `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` (pre-existing `better-sqlite3` ABI mismatch in headless Node — requires `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`).
PTY-dependent test (`test_terminal_blocked_execution.mjs`): blocked by `node-pty` ABI mismatch.

## Pending (Priority Ordered)

1. Gemini post-implementation audit of Phase 7 Sprint B (`ddf6952`).
2. Route next sprint (Phase 7 Sprint C or beyond).
3. Resolve Gemini API quota for real streaming smoke test (billing/project action).
4. MCP provider package resolution checkpoint (fallback still active).

## Known Risks

- Gemini API abort is client-side; aborted requests may still consume provider-side tokens.
- Gemini generateContent quota remains zero in current GCP project.
- Path-with-spaces remains a portability risk for native rebuilds outside validated PowerShell flow.
- MCP provider package remains unresolved in npm registry.
- ConPTY "AttachConsole failed" noise persists in tests; non-blocking.
- `better-sqlite3`/`node-pty` ABI dual-rebuild workflow remains required between Node tests and Electron runtime.
- `safeStorage` unavailable in headless test environments (`PLAINTEXT:` fallback path).
- Monaco worker bundle size is high (`ts.worker`/language chunks), with potential renderer memory overhead on low-end devices.
- Large directory payloads can still stress renderer if users expand very large trees repeatedly (mitigated by exclusions + caps + truncation).
- Lowering custom budget aggressively during active usage can trigger immediate session cut behavior; safe but potentially abrupt UX.

## Mitigations

- Keep live-provider tests conditional until quota/billing enabled.
- Use PowerShell-native rebuild flow for Windows ABI swaps.
- Keep local memory fallback active until MCP package checkpoint resolves.
- Treat ConPTY attach failures as non-blocking test noise (already tolerated in suite).
- Maintain documented dual-rebuild runbook for Node/Electron contexts.
- Preserve bridge-guard pattern (`hasKairoApi`/`getKairoApiOrThrow`) for renderer IPC safety.
- Keep `_isCutting` + idempotent cut lock + worker timeout as invariant in future refactors.
- Consolidation race CLOSED: `_isConsolidating` lock + SYNCED-only DB queries + atomic `markConsolidated()` + input cap.
- Recall race CLOSED: `_isRecalling` guard + UI input disable + `handleStreamingChat` rejection.
- Rate-limit race CLOSED: `retryWithBackoff` is purely sequential per call, no shared mutable state. Non-429 errors propagate immediately.
- Keep file operations async-only and workspace-bound (`FileOperationsService`) to avoid main-thread stalls and sandbox escapes.
- Clamp and validate custom budgets (`CUSTOM_BUDGET_MIN/MAX`) before persistence to prevent invalid runtime budget states.
- UndoManager uses content-based collision guard (not mtime) — Windows mtime resolution is unreliable for sub-second comparisons.
- Ephemeral undo stack cleared on project switch and app restart — no persistent state leak.

## Next Step (Exact)

Gemini ejecuta auditoría post-implementación GO/NO-GO de Phase 7 Sprint B (`ddf6952`). Codex sintetiza veredicto y enruta siguiente sprint.

## Next Owner

- Gemini (auditor): post-implementation audit Phase 7 Sprint B.
- Codex (orchestrator): synthesize verdict and route next sprint.
- Claude (implementer): standby until next sprint routed.

Status: ACTIVE

## Editing Rule (MANDATORY)

THIS FILE IS A LIVE SNAPSHOT (Option B).
Overwrite current state. Remove resolved items. Do not append historical logs here.
Historical rationale belongs to DEB/RFC/governance docs and Git history.

## Scope Boundary

This file must contain only:
- current objective
- active debates/RFCs
- pending priority list
- active risks + mitigations
- exact next step + next owner

Do not duplicate full DEC or long rationale content.

## Current Snapshot

- Active phase: Phase 7 (Testing + Hardening) — Sprint A SEALED (`9e3e7c5`), pending Gemini post-implementation audit.
- Sealed commits: `326071a` (Sprint A hardening), `3c5799c` (Sprint B + stabilization), `756ad33` (Sprint C streaming e2e), `07831d4` (Sprint D cut-pipeline e2e), `64c3813` (Phase 5 Sprint A recall), `a0b30d8` (Phase 5 Sprint B consolidation), `da6c092` (Phase 5 Sprint C rate-limit, GO), `5df7b7a` (Phase 6 Sprint A Monaco editor read/write, GO), `9fc53df` (Phase 6 Sprint B File Explorer lazy tree, GO), `5e3a168` (Phase 6 Sprint C Settings completeness, GO), `88489d1` (Phase 6 Sprint D Impact Analyzer + UndoManager, GO), `9e3e7c5` (Phase 7 Sprint A Safety Net).
- Current objective: Gemini post-implementation audit of Phase 7 Sprint A. Then route next sprint.
- Active debates: none.
- Open RFCs: none.
- IPC channels: 47 (unchanged — test-only sprint).

## Completed This Session

- **Phase 7 Sprint A seal** — commit `9e3e7c5`:

  - TokenBudgeter: 20 functional assertions (budget math, overflow, reset, allocations).
  - Model Router: 9 functional assertions (foreground override, background ignores override).
  - System Prompt Builder: 18 functional assertions (section ordering, visibility, omission).
  - JSON Contract Shapes: 35 source-level assertions (StreamChunk, IpcResult, ChatMessage, union types).
  - Constants Integrity: 25 assertions (allocations sum, budget presets, rate-limit invariants).
  - Zero sealed production files modified — test-only sprint.
  - Gates: `test_safety_net_sprint_a` 107/107, `tsc` exit 0, `electron-vite build` PASS.
  - 1 file committed (test_safety_net_sprint_a.mjs).

Non-sqlite runnable total: 1632 assertions / 0 failures (24 test files).
SQLite-dependent tests (8 files): blocked by `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` (pre-existing `better-sqlite3` ABI mismatch in headless Node — requires `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`).
PTY-dependent test (`test_terminal_blocked_execution.mjs`): blocked by `node-pty` ABI mismatch.

## Pending (Priority Ordered)

1. Gemini post-implementation audit of Phase 7 Sprint A (`9e3e7c5`).
2. Route next sprint (Phase 7 Sprint B or beyond).
3. Resolve handling policy for `test_audit_memory_hacks.mjs` (fix, quarantine, or remove from canonical ledgers).
4. Resolve Gemini API quota for real streaming smoke test (billing/project action).
5. MCP provider package resolution checkpoint (fallback still active).
6. Clean scratch untracked artifacts from working tree (`diff*.txt`, `*_diff.txt`, bundle, audit scratch test).

## Known Risks

- Gemini API abort is client-side; aborted requests may still consume provider-side tokens.
- Gemini generateContent quota remains zero in current GCP project.
- Path-with-spaces remains a portability risk for native rebuilds outside validated PowerShell flow.
- MCP provider package remains unresolved in npm registry.
- ConPTY "AttachConsole failed" noise persists in tests; non-blocking.
- `better-sqlite3`/`node-pty` ABI dual-rebuild workflow remains required between Node tests and Electron runtime.
- `safeStorage` unavailable in headless test environments (`PLAINTEXT:` fallback path).
- `test_audit_memory_hacks.mjs` fails due to ESM `.ts` import resolution and remains untracked scratch.
- Monaco worker bundle size is high (`ts.worker`/language chunks), with potential renderer memory overhead on low-end devices.
- Large directory payloads can still stress renderer if users expand very large trees repeatedly (mitigated by exclusions + caps + truncation).
- Lowering custom budget aggressively during active usage can trigger immediate session cut behavior; safe but potentially abrupt UX.

## Mitigations

- Keep live-provider tests conditional until quota/billing enabled.
- Use PowerShell-native rebuild flow for Windows ABI swaps.
- Keep local memory fallback active until MCP package checkpoint resolves.
- Treat ConPTY attach failures as non-blocking test noise (already tolerated in suite).
- Maintain documented dual-rebuild runbook for Node/Electron contexts.
- Preserve bridge-guard pattern (`hasKairoApi`/`getKairoApiOrThrow`) for renderer IPC safety.
- Keep `_isCutting` + idempotent cut lock + worker timeout as invariant in future refactors.
- Exclude scratch tests/artifacts from release ledgers unless promoted to canonical suite.
- Consolidation race CLOSED: `_isConsolidating` lock + SYNCED-only DB queries + atomic `markConsolidated()` + input cap.
- Recall race CLOSED: `_isRecalling` guard + UI input disable + `handleStreamingChat` rejection.
- Rate-limit race CLOSED: `retryWithBackoff` is purely sequential per call, no shared mutable state. Non-429 errors propagate immediately.
- Keep file operations async-only and workspace-bound (`FileOperationsService`) to avoid main-thread stalls and sandbox escapes.
- Clamp and validate custom budgets (`CUSTOM_BUDGET_MIN/MAX`) before persistence to prevent invalid runtime budget states.
- UndoManager uses content-based collision guard (not mtime) — Windows mtime resolution is unreliable for sub-second comparisons.
- Ephemeral undo stack cleared on project switch and app restart — no persistent state leak.

## Next Step (Exact)

Gemini ejecuta auditoría post-implementación GO/NO-GO de Phase 7 Sprint A (`9e3e7c5`). Codex sintetiza veredicto y enruta siguiente sprint.

## Next Owner

- Gemini (auditor): post-implementation audit Phase 7 Sprint A.
- Codex (orchestrator): synthesize verdict and route next sprint.
- Claude (implementer): standby until next sprint routed.
